                        <li><h2>What is fusing</h2></li>
                        <div><h4>Fusing is the technique of joining two or more pieces of glass by heat in a kiln. There are different glass fusing techniques. For example, “tack fusing” is a fusing technique in which the pieces of glass are heated until they are just hot enough to stick together and retain many of their own original characteristics. In a full fuse, on the other hand, glass is heated until it becomes molten.

                            Fusing requires a special type of glass. Specifically, the different glasses you use must all be compatible with each other. We recommend using Bullseye kiln-glass for fusing projects because we test and label all of the glass we manufacture for compatibility. When using one or more different types of glass, you’ll need to perform your own tests for compatability.
                            
                            Many people use the terms “fusing” and “kilnforming” interchangeably; however, that is not entirely correct as fusing is one of many kilnforming methods. People also tend to use “kiln-glass” and “fused glass” interchangeably, though we prefer to reserve “fused glass” for finished projects that have already been fired in a kiln and fused with another piece of glass. Fused glass art can be any number of things: from slumped bowls and platters, to printed imagery, to anything else the mind can conceive and make.
                            
                            At Bullseye, we manufacture a variety of kiln-glasses that can be used for fusing. This also includes accessory glasses like frit, powder, rod, and stringer.</h4></div>
                        <li><h2>What temperature should I use for fusing?</h2></li>
                        <div><h4>Since temperatures and firing schedules can vary depending on the project you're making, there's no single answer to this question.

                                We do offer suggested firing schedules for specific projects on many of the articles and projects on our Methods & Ideas page. These work well if you know what you want to make.
                                
                                In TechNote 4: Heat & Glass, you'll find basic principles for fusing glass. Many of our video lessons also cover fusing.
                                
                                The important thing to know is that there are a few considerations to make before deciding on a fusing schedule. Rather than suggesting schedules, it's more productive to learn the science behind what's happening in the kiln, how a certain glass reacts at a given temperature, and how heat is transmitted throughout your kiln.</h4></div>
                        <li><h2>Why should I fuse and slump glass in separate firings?</h2></li>
                        <div><h4>Fusing and slumping are two unique processes, requiring their own unique firing schedules to get right. It's not possible to conduct these processes simultaneously. A firing schedule designed with the objective of fusing and slumping at the same time will not effectively accomplish either.

                            Full fusing temperatures are much higher than slumping temperatures. If you were to try to fuse and slump simultaneously by firing to full fuse temperatures, you would end up with a misshapen piece of glass with large air bubbles. The glass would also likely stick to the mold.
                            
                            Fusing before slumping allows you to avoid potential problems with air bubbles, while also exercising greater control over the final outcome of the piece.</h4></div>
